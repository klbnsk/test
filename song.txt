When I stare in your eyes
You'll be there forever
To watch our life (to watch our life together)
You just like going to Heaven (my heart)
Oh, your vanity
I'm fallin', and I'm drownin'
But you're takin' me
One thousand on my feet
Stacks spreaded on my seat
Ten thousand on my eyes
Rollie Pollie on my wrist
Gotta make a flight, big day, slummin' on FaceTime
Fifty K, wonderin' why I'm stormin' off, no race
Emboldened by the bliss
I was sworn in by a kiss
